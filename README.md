# PREDICTING-AND-VISUALIZING-PLAYERS-IMPROVEMENT-IN-NBA-LEAGUE-
<p>NBA, the best basketball league, has millions of fans around the world cheering their favorite
player/team. Team franchises eye on acquiring players that help them win championship. They 
mostly look out for players who gradually improved over seasons. Player performance, varies from 
season to season and their pay is mostly determined by their previous season performance. Every 
year, a few of players progress considerably from the previous year. Those players add a lot of 
value to the teams they play for, both competitively and financially. The NBA recognizes their 
importance by awarding the Most Improved Player (MIP) Award to the player who has improved 
the most over the previous season. As a result, franchises benefit from being able to precisely 
estimate if and how much a player will progress in the coming season.</p><br>
<p>Hence, we aim to contribute the franchises on depicting the factors that influence a player's 
success and predict their performance for the next season so that franchises can pick players who 
tend to improve based on their previous performance and fantasy league players can know who to 
watch for the coming season. </p>
